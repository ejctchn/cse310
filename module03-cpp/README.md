# Overview

This software is meant to take in a subtotal, and reflect back the total with taxes included as well as any discounts accrued.
It takes into consideration the day of the week, and whether or not you are on a date. It also asks whether you are a student 
or not, depending on the day. You are prompted to enter either 'y' or 'n'. If you type something other than that, it will throw an error, asking the user to try again.
