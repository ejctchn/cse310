# Overview

This is a Snake game, made to help me better understand the Unity Engine and C#. The Snake game follows the rules of the old snake game. Don't touch the walls, and don't run into yourself. 

Use the WASD keys to control your snake. Use ESC to pause the game. 
NOTE: The save feature does not yet work.

# Development Environment

I used Unity, and Unity Hub to make the game. 
I used Visual Studio Code to write the C# that I needed to make the game run.

# Future Work

* I want to add a Save Game Feature.
* I want to add sounds to when the snake interacts with the surroundings.
* I want to change the speed of the Snake to increase difficulty.
